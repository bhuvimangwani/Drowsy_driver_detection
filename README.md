# Driver Drowsiness Detection

 ## Project Overview

This project is designed to detect driver drowsiness using advanced deep learning techniques. It leverages Transfer Learning with InceptionResNetV2 and a custom CNN architecture featuring Parallel Convolution layers to achieve high performance.

## Dataset

Source: Driver Drowsiness Dataset (DDD)

Categories: Drowsy and Non-Drowsy images

Purpose: Train and evaluate model performance

## Setup and Requirements

Ensure the following libraries are installed:

pip install tensorflow pandas matplotlib seaborn opencv-python pillow

## Data Pipeline

### 1Ô∏è Data Preparation

Organized dataset: Drowsy and Non-Drowsy categories

Dataframes: Manage file paths and labels

Visualization: Count plot to inspect category balance

### 2Ô∏è Data Augmentation and Splitting

Augmentation: Rotation, zoom, shear (via ImageDataGenerator)

Split: Training, Validation, Test sets using train_test_split

 ## Model Architecture

### üîπ Transfer Learning Model

Uses InceptionResNetV2 pretrained weights

Fine-tuned on the Driver Drowsiness Dataset

### üîπ Custom Parallel CNN

Parallel Convolution layers to capture diverse features

‚úÖ Optimizer: Adamax
‚úÖ Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

 ## Results

| Model            | Accuracy |
|------------------|----------|
|Transfer Learning | 99.73%   |
| Custom CNN       | 99.90%   |
